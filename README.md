<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

## 📖 Project Overview <a name="about-project"></a>

The interactive comment project is a web-based application that allows users to post and view comments. Built using the React library, Tailwind CSS, PrimeReact, Formik, TypeScript, and Firebase, the project offers a highly responsive and modern user interface. Users can post comments on a topic or article, view comments posted by others, and reply to comments. The application also features real-time updates, so users can see new comments as they are posted. Additionally, Firebase provides a secure backend database for storing comments and user information, ensuring the application is reliable and secure.
